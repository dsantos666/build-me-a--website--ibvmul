You want a mobile app built with React Native and Expo to sell custom fang caps, schedule appointments, answer customer questions, display pictures, and list prices. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Home Screen:** Display featured fang designs, a welcome message, and clear calls to action (e.g., \"Shop Fangs,\" \"Book Appointment,\" \"Ask a Question\").\n*   **Fang Gallery:** A scrollable gallery showcasing different fang styles with images and prices.\n*   **Appointment Booking:** A simple form or integration with a calendar service to allow customers to schedule appointments.\n*   **FAQ/Contact:** A section to answer frequently asked questions and provide contact information.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\nGiven the \"Nightmare fangs\" image you provided, let's go with a dark, edgy theme:\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#121212` (Very Dark Gray)\n    *   Text: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#A9A9A9` (Dark Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#FF4136` (Bright Red - accent color from the image)\n    *   Secondary: `#B10DC9` (Purple - a complementary color to red)\n    *   Accent: `#FFDC00` (Yellow - for highlights and calls to action)\n    *   Card: `#1E1E1E` (Slightly lighter than the background)\n    *   Highlight: `#FF4136` (Bright Red - same as primary)\n*   **Typography:**\n    *   Use a modern, slightly gothic font for headings (e.g., \"Bebas Neue\" or a similar free font from Google Fonts).\n    *   Use a clean, readable sans-serif font for body text (e.g., \"Open Sans\" or \"Roboto\").\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\n1.  **Create a new `Fang` component:** This component will display the image and price of each fang.\n2.  **Modify the Home Screen (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`):**\n    *   Remove the modalDemos array.\n    *   Add a section to display featured fang designs using the `Fang` component.\n    *   Add buttons or links to navigate to the \"Fang Gallery,\" \"Appointment Booking,\" and \"FAQ/Contact\" sections.\n3.  **Create a Fang Gallery Screen:**\n    *   Create a new file in the `app/(tabs)` directory called `gallery.tsx`.\n    *   Use a `FlatList` or `ScrollView` to display the `Fang` components in a grid or list.\n4.  **Create an Appointment Booking Screen:**\n    *   Create a new file in the `app/(tabs)` directory called `appointment.tsx`.\n    *   Implement a simple form with fields for name, email, phone number, and desired appointment date/time.\n5.  **Create an FAQ/Contact Screen:**\n    *   Create a new file in the `app/(tabs)` directory called `faq.tsx`.\n    *   Display a list of frequently asked questions and answers.\n    *   Provide contact information (e.g., email address, phone number).\n6.  **Update the Tab Layout (`app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`):**\n    *   Add tabs for the \"Gallery\", \"Appointment\", and \"FAQ\" screens.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n\nI will now instruct the coding agent to implement the plan and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\nGive instruction for the coding agent after you that the the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-19T15:40:33.085092"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a custom fang cap shop app with a gallery, appointment booking, and FAQ section.
